            Hello, My name is Bryan Smith. I am a very self driven person and
            have worked with teams and by myself in many capacities in life. At
            a very young age I started building computers and trying to give
            myself a base understanding of coding originally with linux scripts
            and game development. I have also spent a large amount of my life
            competing both in sports and gaming. This has lead me to be in many
            team leadership positions to work towards a mutual end goal or even
            drive myself towards success.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now here is a brief introduction to my work history and where I have
            come from to reach this time in my life. I spent a day working with
            the Attorney General's Office for Washington State on IT work. I
            also spent many years going around different jobs with dealerships,
            restaurants, and retail sales. A part of this retail experience was
            at Best Buy where I was someone that was looked to for information
            in Mobile and PC departments due to my experience as well as
            assisting the Geek Squad with service at times. I am now looking to
            take the next step in my career as I finish up this Fullstack Coding
            Bootcamp and look to excel in Coding in any capacity.
          </p>
