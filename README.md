# AdvancedCSS-Portfolio

## Description

- My motivation for this project was seeing other professionals in the field using webpages for their portfolios.
- I built this to have a one stop shop that shows all my prior works when applying for jobs. 
- This solves the problem of having to explain or search for prior works to show potential employers.
- I learned a good amount about flexbox syntax while trying to make a lot of these features function and look correct.
